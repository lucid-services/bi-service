> **Routing** refers to the definition of application end points (URIs) and how they respond to client requests.
###### *source:expressjs.com*

Routes are created from {@link Router} common factory objects:  

```javascript
    const appManager = service.appManager;

    const router = appManager.get('app-name').buildRouter({
        version: 1.0,
        url: '/api/{version}/user' //{version} placeholder will get replaced by the actual router version
    });
```

The following is an example of very basic route:  

```javascript
    const route = router.buildRoute({
        type: 'get', //HTTP method type. One of the: `all`, `get`, `post`, `put`, `head`, `connect`, `options`, `delete`
        url : '/:username', //route endpoint can be also defined as a regular expression
        summary: 'Returns basics user data of a user with the :username',
        desc: 'Longer description of the endpoint'
    });

    route.main(function(req, res) {
        //pseudo-code
        return UserModel.fetch(req.params.username).then(function(user) {
            res.json(user);
        });
    });
```

The above example shows that the end points are defined on an {@link App Application} object recevied from the {@link AppManager}.  
The Application is an abstraction object which implements {@link AppInterface Application Interface}.  
`serviser` comes with {@link App http(s) implementation} of the `ApplicationInterface` using `expressjs` library under the hood,  
however the interface implementation is not limited to `HTTP` protocol as anything that matches the request & response pattern (shell commands, message-queue protocols etc..) can share the same user-facing interface.  
Practical examples of such usage are [serviser-shell](https://github.com/lucid-services/serviser-shell) & [serviser-rabbitmq](https://github.com/lucid-services/serviser-rabbitmq) plugins.
